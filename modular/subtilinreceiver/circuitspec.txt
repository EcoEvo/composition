#1)Interactions between parts:
#Each part model includes rules for all interactions of the part. When the model of a desired system is built, duplicate rules are removed.
#We have two types of promoters
#   constitutive promoter:
#   a promoter with a TFBS in the middle. If the TF is an activator then the transcription rate is higher in the bound state. If the TF is a repressor, 
#transcription rate is lower in the bound state.
# In the future we will implement a generic terminator model that can also be used to represent operators which can be used as repressors throughout the circuits.
